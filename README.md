# Aazami
Project for MakeUofT 2023

- Note that we utilized Open Source [Neo Pixel Library Code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) and [Edge Impulse ingestion SDK Code](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/reference/data-ingestion/ingestion-api) other than the code we have included in this repository. The primary use was to load the ML data into Arduino Nano BLE 33
